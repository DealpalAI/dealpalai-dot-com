    <p class="text-lg max-w-prose mb-4">
      Dealpal AI was founded by a small team of entrepreneurs, engineers, psychologists, and data scientists who see the world of influencer marketing as vastly inefficient. We believe that the future of influencer marketing is automated, algorithmic, and agentic. We are building a first of its kind tools to make that future a reality.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg max-w-prose mb-4">
      The founders started their journey in building Dealpal in the late summer of 2023 at a local startup incubator located in the heart of Venice Beach, California. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/k3nneth/" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 underline">Ken Cavanagh</a>, who has a Master's degree in psychology and spent the last several years of his career in operations engineering at SpaceX, was a regular at the incubator's Sunday hackathons where he was working on and advising a number of AI projects.

    <p class="text-lg max-w-prose mb-4">
     It was there that Ken met his co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-boniardi/" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 underline">Eric Boniardi</a>, who was just finishing up his graduate thesis at USC on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07816" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 underline">using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect influence campaigns on social media</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg max-w-prose">
      After making several connections with local influencer marketing agencies in the area, the two quickly realized that they had a shared vision for the future of AI in influencer marketing and decided to join forces. They spent the next several months building the first version of Dealpal AI, which they now believe will soon be the industry standard for influencer marketing.
